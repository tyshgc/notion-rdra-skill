## SkillPort Skills

Skills are reusable expert knowledge that help you complete tasks effectively.
Each skill contains step-by-step instructions, templates, and scripts.

### Workflow

1. **Find a skill** - Check the list below for a skill matching your task
2. **Get instructions** - Run `skillport show <skill-id>` to load full instructions
3. **Follow the instructions** - Execute the steps using your available tools

### Tips

- Skills may include scripts - execute them via the skill's path, don't read them into context
- If instructions reference `{path}`, replace it with the skill's directory path
- When uncertain, check the skill's description to confirm it matches your task
